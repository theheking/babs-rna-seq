`Functions used within exploratory text`
> Questions/Challenges
>>  You will find questions and extra activities scattered throughout the instructions. These are not assessed but will help you to understand the processes and associated theory lectures.


**Information**
- ** You will also find information boxes like this scattered throughout the manual. These contain general reusable hints and tips rather than specific topic commands etc. These will generally be repeated in the  **Tricks and**** Tips** section of the handbook and/or course site. **




**NOTE:**  It is recommended that you also use a fixed width font (e.g. Consolas) and colour formatting when documenting code in your own lab books to help it stand out from other thoughts/instructions.
