> Questions/Challenges
>>  You will find questions and extra activities scattered throughout the instructions. These are not assessed but will help you to understand the processes and associated theory lectures.


<em>**These contain general reusable hints and tips rather than specific topic commands etc.**</em>





**NOTE:**  It is recommended that you also use a fixed width font (e.g. Consolas) and colour formatting when documenting code in your own lab books to help it stand out from other thoughts/instructions.
